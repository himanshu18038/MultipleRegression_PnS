README
In this project, we have to use the concept of multiple linear regressions. So, in the given data set I have identified 9 different parameters on which the output Impact Factor can depend. Then using complex mathematical operations I am able to generate all the possible combinations of input, which turns out to be 511 in number. I have used 2 files for getting input and output matrices and they aare found.txt and WebData.csv. All the errors are reported in a csv file called Error.csv which will be produced once the code is run. Also, after executing the code, it shows the minimum absolute and minimum mean squared error and the respective combination name.

Language Used - Python3
Script File - Assignment2_2018038.py
Pre-Requisite Files - WebData.csv & found.txt
Files Produced - Error.csv
